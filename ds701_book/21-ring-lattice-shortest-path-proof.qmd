Certainly! The simplification in step 5 arises from considering the distribution of distances in a ring lattice and how they contribute to the average shortest path length.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Distance Distribution**:
   - In a ring lattice, each node is connected to its nearest neighbors, and the distance between any two nodes $i$ and $j$ is given by:

$$
d(i, j) = \min(|i-j|, n - |i-j|)
$$

   - This formula accounts for the circular nature of the lattice, where you can travel either clockwise or counterclockwise to reach another node.

2. **Distance Contribution**:

   - For a node $i$, the distance to another node $j$ is determined by the smaller of the two possible paths (clockwise or counterclockwise).
   - As you move further from node $i$, the distance initially increases linearly until you reach the halfway point around the circle, after which it starts decreasing symmetrically.

3. **Summing Over All Pairs**:

   - The total distance for all pairs of nodes is calculated by summing the distances for each pair and then dividing by the number of pairs:
     $$
     L = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0, j \neq i}^{n-1} d(i, j)
     $$
   - For each node $i$, the distances to other nodes range from 1 to $n/2$ (assuming $n$ is even for simplicity), and then symmetrically back to 1.

4. **Approximation for Large $n$**:

   - For large $n$, the average distance from a node to all other nodes can be approximated by considering that, on average, you traverse about a quarter of the way around the circle to reach another node.
   - This is because the average distance is roughly the midpoint of the maximum distance, which is $n/2$. Therefore, the average distance is approximately $n/4$.

   For skip connections of 2, then the average path length is $n/8$, or 1/2 of n/4.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The approximation $L \approx n/4$ reflects the fact that in a ring lattice, the average path length grows linearly with the number of nodes $n$, but at a slower rate than the maximum possible distance, due to the circular structure and symmetry.

This simplification is particularly useful for large $n$ where the exact calculation becomes cumbersome, and the approximation provides a good estimate of the average shortest path length.
