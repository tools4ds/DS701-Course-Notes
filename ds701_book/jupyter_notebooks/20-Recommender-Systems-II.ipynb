        "There are a number of concerns with the widespread use of recommender systems and personalization in society.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, recommender systems are accused of creating __filter bubbles.__ \n",
        "\n",
        "A filter bubble is the tendency for recommender systems to limit the variety of information presented to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concern is that a user's past expression of interests will guide the algorithm in continuing to provide \"more of the same.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is believed to increase polarization in society, and to reinforce confirmation bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Maximizing Engagement\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, recommender systems in modern usage are often tuned to __maximize engagement.__\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, the objective function of the system is not to present the user's most favored content, but rather the content that will be most likely to keep the user on the site.\n",
        "\n",
        "The incentive to maximize engagement arises on sites that are supported by advertising revenue.   \n",
        "\n",
        "More engagement time means more revenue for the site.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Extreme Content\n",
        "\n",
        "However, many studies have shown that sites that strive to __maximize \n",
        "engagement__ do so in large part by guiding users toward __extreme content:__\n",
        "\n",
        "* content that is shocking, \n",
        "* or feeds conspiracy theories, \n",
        "* or presents extreme views on popular topics.\n",

        "Given this tendency of modern recommender systems, \n",
        "for a third party to create \"clickbait\" content such as this, one of the easiest\n",

        "\n",
        "Methods for addressing these issues are being very actively studied at present.\n",
