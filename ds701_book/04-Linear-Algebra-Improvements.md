# Notes on Improvements to make to 04-Linear-Algebra-Refresher

Consider reordering the entire lecture to start with simple systems of linear 
equations and how to represent them as vectors and matrices, and then how to
solve them, types of solutions, what the A matrices says about the solutions.
Then go into the geometry of linear algebra, etc. See Strang MIT OCW linear
algebra course for ideas.

Make the figures interactive. 
For example on scalar multiplications of vectors, have a slider to change scaler
values between -2 and 2.
