When parents are taller or shorter than average, their children are more likely
to be closer to the average height than their parents.

So called **"regression to the mean."**

Galton fit a straight line to this effect, and the fitting of lines or curves to
data has come to be called regression as well.

In the 60s, psychologist Daniel Kahneman studied the effect of praise versus
punishment on performance of Israeli Air Force trainees. He was led to believe
that praise was more effective than punishment.

Air force trainers disagreed and said that when they praised pilots that did well,
they usually did worse the next time, and when they punished pilots that did poorly,
they usually did better the next time.
::::

:::: {.fragment}
What Khaneman later realised was that this phenomenon could be explained by
the idea of regression to the mean.

If a pilot does worse than average on a task, they are more likely to do better
the next time, and if they do better than average, they are more likely to do
worse the next time.

## Model Types

The most common form of machine learning is __regression__, which means
constructing an equation that describes the relationships among variables.

It is a form of supervised learning: 

* whereas __classification__ deals with predicting categorical features (labels or classes), 
* __regression__ deals with predicting continuous features (real values).

## Fit to Linear Models

For example, we may look at these points and decide to model them using a line.

```{python}
#| hide_input: true
#| tags: [hide-input]
ax = plt.figure(figsize = (7, 7)).add_subplot()
centerAxes(ax)
line = np.array([1, 0.5])
xlin = -10.0 + 20.0 * np.random.random(100)
ylin = line[0] + (line[1] * xlin) + np.random.randn(100)
ax.plot(xlin, ylin, 'ro', markersize = 4);
```

## Fit to Quadratic Models

We may look at these points and decide to model them using a quadratic function.

```{python}
#| hide_input: true
#| tags: [hide-input]
ax = plt.figure(figsize = (7, 7)).add_subplot()
centerAxes(ax)
quad = np.array([1, 3, 0.5])
std = 8.0
xquad = -10.0 + 20.0 * np.random.random(100)
yquad = quad[0] + (quad[1] * xquad) + (quad[2] * xquad * xquad) + std * np.random.randn(100)
ax.plot(xquad, yquad, 'ro', markersize = 4);
```


## Fit to Logarithmic Models

And we may look at these points and decide to model them using a logarithmic function.

```{python}
#| hide_input: true
#| tags: [hide-input]
ax = plt.figure(figsize = (7, 7)).add_subplot()
centerAxes(ax)
log = np.array([1, 4])  
std = 1.5
xlog = 10.0 * np.random.random(100)
ylog = log[0] + log[1] * np.log(xlog) + std * np.random.randn(100)
ax.plot(xlog, ylog, 'ro', markersize=4);
```

---

Clearly, none of these datasets agrees perfectly with the proposed model.   

So the question arises:

How do we find the __best__ linear function (or quadratic function, or logarithmic function) given the data?

# Framework

## Framework

This problem has been studied extensively in the field of statistics.   

Certain terminology is used:

* Some values are referred to as "independent," and
* Some values are referred to as "dependent."

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Framework cont.
:::

The basic regression task is:

* given a set of independent variables 
* and the associated dependent variables, 
* estimate the parameters of a model (such as a line, parabola, etc) that describes
  how the dependent variables are related to the independent variables.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Framework cont.
:::

The **independent variables** are collected into a matrix $X,$ sometimes called the
__design matrix.__

The dependent variables are collected into an __observation__ vector $\mathbf{y}.$

The parameters of the model (for any kind of model) are collected into a 
__parameter__ vector $\mathbf{\beta}.$

```{python}
ax = plt.figure(figsize = (7, 7)).add_subplot()
centerAxes(ax)
line = np.array([1, 0.5])
xlin = -10.0 + 20.0 * np.random.random(100)
ylin = line[0] + (line[1] * xlin) + np.random.randn(100)
ax.plot(xlin, ylin, 'ro', markersize = 4)
ax.plot(xlin, line[0] + line[1] * xlin, 'b-')
plt.text(-9, 3, r'$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$', size=20);
```

## Least-Squares Lines

The first kind of model we'll study is a linear equation, $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.$

Experimental data often produce points $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ that seem
to lie close to a line.   

We want to determine the parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1$ that define a line that is
as "close" to the points as possible.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Least-Squares Lines cont.
:::

Suppose we have a line $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$.   

For each data point $(x_j, y_j),$ there is a point $(x_j, \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_j)$
that is the point on the line with the same $x$-coordinate.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some data points
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([3.7, 2.0, 2.1, 0.1, 1.5])

beta_0 = 4  # intercept
beta_1 = -0.8  # slope

We call 

* $y_j$ the __observed__ value of $y$ and 
* $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_j$ the __predicted__ $y$-value.   

:::
::::

:::: {.fragment}
The difference between an observed $y$-value and a predicted $y$-value is called
a __residual__.
::::

:::: {.fragment}
There are several ways of measure how "close" the line is to the data. 
::::

:::: {.fragment}
The usual choice is to sum the squares of the residuals.  
::::

:::: {.fragment}
The __least-squares line__ is the line $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ that minimizes
the sum of squares of the residuals. 

The coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1$ of the line are called
__regression coefficients.__
::::

## A least-squares problem

If the data points were on the line, the parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ would satisfy the equations

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 &= y_1 \\
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_2 &= y_2 \\
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_3 &= y_3 \\
&\vdots \\
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_n &= y_n
\end{align*}
$$

We can write this system as 

$$
X\mathbf{\beta} = \mathbf{y}
$$

where 

$$
X=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_1 \\
1 & x_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
1 & x_n
\end{bmatrix},
\;\;\mathbf{\beta} = \begin{bmatrix}\beta_0\\\beta_1\end{bmatrix},
\;\;\mathbf{y}=\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\\vdots\\y_n\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

Of course, if the data points don't actually lie exactly on a line, 

... then there are no parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1$ for which the predicted
$y$-values in $X\mathbf{\beta}$ equal the observed $y$-values in $\mathbf{y}$, 

... and $X\mathbf{\beta}=\mathbf{y}$ has no solution.

---

Now, since the data doesn't fall exactly on a line, we have decided to seek the
$\beta$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, i.e.,

$$
\sum_i (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i - y_i)^2
=\Vert X\beta -\mathbf{y}\Vert^2
$$

This is key: 

::: {.callout-important}
__The sum of squares of the residuals__ is __exactly__ the 
__square of the distance between the vectors $X\mathbf{\beta}$ and $\mathbf{y}.$__
:::

---

Computing the least-squares solution of $X\beta = \mathbf{y}$ is equivalent to
finding the $\mathbf{\beta}$ that determines the least-squares line.

```{python}
ax = plt.figure(figsize = (7, 7)).add_subplot()
centerAxes(ax)
line = np.array([1, 0.5])
xlin = -10.0 + 20.0 * np.random.random(100)
ylin = line[0] + (line[1] * xlin) + np.random.randn(100)
ax.plot(xlin, ylin, 'ro', markersize = 4)
ax.plot(xlin, line[0] + line[1] * xlin, 'b-')
plt.text(-9, 3, r'$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$', size=20);
```

---

Now, to obtain the least-squares line, find the least-squares solution to
$X\mathbf{\beta} = \mathbf{y}.$

From linear algebra we know that the least squares solution of
$X\mathbf{\beta} = \mathbf{y}$ is given by the solution of the __normal equations__:

$$
X^TX\mathbf{\beta} = X^T\mathbf{y}
$$

because $X\mathbf{\beta} - \mathbf{y}$ is normal (e.g. orthogonal) to the column
space of $X.$    

:::: {.fragment}
We also know that the normal equations __always__ have at least one solution.

And if $X^TX$ is invertible, there is a unique solution that is given by:
    
$$
\hat{\mathbf{\beta}} = (X^TX)^{-1} X^T\mathbf{y}
$$

::::


# The General Linear Model

## The General Linear Model

Another way that the inconsistent linear system is often written is to collect
all the residuals into a __residual vector.__ 

Then an exact equation is

$$
y = X\mathbf{\beta} + {\mathbf\epsilon}
$$

where $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is the __residual vector.__

Any equation of this form is referred to as a __linear model.__ 

In this formulation, the goal is to find the $\beta$ so as to minimize the
__norm__ of $\epsilon$, i.e., $\Vert\epsilon\Vert.$

:::: {.fragment}
In some cases, one would like to fit data points with something other than a
straight line.  

In cases like this, the matrix equation is still $X\mathbf{\beta} = \mathbf{y}$,
but the specific form of $X$ changes from one problem to the next.
::::

## Least-Squares Fitting of Other Models

In model fitting, the parameters of the model are what is unknown.  

A central question for us is whether the model is _linear_ in its parameters.

For example, is this model linear in its parameters?

$$
y = \beta_0 e^{-\beta_1 x}
$$

:::: {.fragment}
It __is not__ linear in its parameters.  
::::

:::: {.fragment}
Is this model linear in its parameters?

$$
y = \beta_0 e^{-2 x}
$$
::::

:::: {.fragment}
It __is__ linear in its parameters.
::::

---

For a model that is linear in its parameters, an observation is a linear
combination of (arbitrary) known functions.

In other words, a model that is linear in its parameters is

$$
y = \beta_0f_0(x) + \beta_1f_1(x) + \dots + \beta_nf_n(x)
$$

where $f_0, \dots, f_n$ are known functions and $\beta_0,\dots,\beta_k$ are
parameters.

## Example

Suppose data points $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ appear to lie along some
sort of parabola instead of a straight line.  

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
ax = plt.figure(figsize = (5, 5)).add_subplot()
centerAxes(ax)
quad = np.array([1, 3, 0.5])
xquad = -10.0 + 20.0 * np.random.random(100)
yquad = quad[0] + (quad[1] * xquad) + (quad[2] * xquad * xquad) + 2*np.random.randn(100)
ax.plot(xquad, yquad, 'ro', markersize = 4);
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

As a result, we wish to approximate the data by an equation of the form

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2.
$$

Let's describe the linear model that produces a "least squares fit" of the data by the equation.

:::
::::

## Solution
  
The ideal relationship is $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2.$

Suppose the actual values of the parameters are $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2.$  
Then the coordinates of the first data point satisfy the equation

$$
y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_1^2 + \epsilon_1
$$

where $\epsilon_1$ is the residual error between the observed value $y_1$ and
the predicted $y$-value.

Each data point determines a similar equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
y_1 &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_1^2 + \epsilon_1 \\
y_2 &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_2 + \beta_2x_2^2 + \epsilon_2 \\
&\vdots \\
y_n &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_n + \beta_2x_n^2 + \epsilon_n
\end{align*}
$$

---

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Clearly, this system can be written as $\mathbf{y} = X\mathbf{\beta} + \mathbf{\epsilon}.$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
\vdots\\
y_n
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}1&x_1&x_1^2\\
1&x_2&x_2^2\\
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\
1&x_n&x_n^2
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\\
beta_1\\\
beta_2
\end{bmatrix}
 + 
 \begin{bmatrix}
 \epsilon_1\\
 \epsilon_2\\
 \vdots\\
 \epsilon_n
 \end{bmatrix}
 $$

Let's solve for $\beta.$

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
m = np.shape(xquad)[0]
X = np.array([np.ones(m), xquad, xquad**2]).T
beta = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ yquad
```


:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

And plot the results.

```{python}
ax = ut.plotSetup(-10, 10, -10, 20)
ut.centerAxes(ax)
xplot = np.linspace(-10, 10, 50)
yestplot = beta[0] + beta[1] * xplot + beta[2] * xplot**2
ax.plot(xplot, yestplot, 'b-', lw=2)
ax.plot(xquad, yquad, 'ro', markersize=4);
```

:::
::::


---

Now let's try a different model.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
m = np.shape(xlog)[0]
X = np.array([np.ones(m), np.log(xlog)]).T
beta = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ ylog
```

And plot the results.

```{python}
# 
# plot the results
#
ax = ut.plotSetup(-10,10,-10,15)
ut.centerAxes(ax)
xplot = np.logspace(np.log10(0.0001),1,100)
yestplot = beta[0]+beta[1]*np.log(xplot)
ax.plot(xplot,yestplot,'b-',lw=2)
ax.plot(xlog,ylog,'ro',markersize=4);
```

## Multiple Regression

Suppose an experiment involves two independent variables -- say, $u$ and $v$, --
and one dependent variable, $y$.  

A simple equation for predicting $y$ from $u$ and $v$ has the form

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 u + \beta_2 v
$$

Since there is more than one independent variable, this is called
__multiple regression.__

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Multiple Regression, cont.
:::

A more general prediction equation might have the form

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 u + \beta_2 v + \beta_3u^2 + \beta_4 uv + \beta_5 v^2
$$

A least squares fit to equations like this is called a __trend surface.__

In general, a linear model will arise whenever $y$ is to be predicted by an equation of the form

$$
y = \beta_0f_0(u,v) + \beta_1f_1(u,v) + \cdots + \beta_kf_k(u,v)
$$

with $f_0,\dots,f_k$ any sort of known functions and $\beta_0,...,\beta_k$ unknown weights.

## Example

Let's take an example.   Here are a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$:

```{python}
ax = ut.plotSetup3d(-7, 7, -7, 7, -10, 10, figsize = (7, 7))
v = [4.0, 4.0, 2.0]
u = [-4.0, 3.0, 1.0]
npts = 50

# set locations of points that fall within x,y
xc = -7.0 + 14.0 * np.random.random(npts)
yc = -7.0 + 14.0 * np.random.random(npts)
A = np.array([u,v]).T

# project these points onto the plane
P = A @ np.linalg.inv(A.T @ A) @ A.T
coords = P @ np.array([xc, yc, np.zeros(npts)])
coords[2] += np.random.randn(npts)
ax.plot(coords[0], coords[1], 'ro', zs=coords[2], markersize = 6);
```

## Example

In geography, local models of terrain are constructed from data

$$
(u_1, v_1, y_1), \dots, (u_n, v_n, y_n)
$$

where $u_j, v_j$, and $y_j$ are latitude, longitude, and altitude, respectively.

:::: {.fragment}
Let's describe the linear models that gives a least-squares fit to such data.  
The solution is called the least-squares _plane._
::::

## Solution

We expect the data to satisfy these equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
y_1 &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 u_1 + \beta_2 v_1 + \beta_3 y_1 + \epsilon_1 \\
y_2 &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 u_2 + \beta_2 v_2 + \beta_3 y_2 + \epsilon_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 u_n + \beta_2 v_n + \beta_3 y_n + \epsilon_n
\end{align*}
$$

This system has the matrix for $\mathbf{y} = X\mathbf{\beta} + \epsilon,$ where

$$
\mathbf{y} = 
\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\

This example shows that the linear model for multiple regression has the same
form as the model for the simple regression in the earlier examples.

We can see that the general principle is the same across all the different
kinds of linear models.

:::: {.fragment}
Once $X$ is defined properly, the normal equations for $\mathbf{\beta}$ have the
same matrix form, no matter how many variables are involved.

Thus, for any linear model where $X^TX$ is invertible, the least squares estimate is

$$
\hat{\mathbf{\beta}} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\mathbf{y}.
$$

## Measuring the fit of a regression model: $R^2$

Given any $X$ and $\mathbf{y}$, the above algorithm will produce an output
$\hat{\beta}$.

But how do we know whether the data is in fact well described by the model?

:::: {.fragment}
The most common measure of fit is $R^2$.

$R^2$ measures the __fraction of the variance__ of $\mathbf{y}$ that can be
explained by the model $X\hat{\beta}$.

The variance of $\mathbf{y}$ is 

$$
\text{Var}(\mathbf{y}) =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\overline{y}\right)^2
$$

where $\overline{y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$.
::::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Measuring the fit, cont.
:::

For any given $n$, we can equally work with just 
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\overline{y}\right)^2
$$

which is called the __Total Sum of Squares__ (TSS).

## Total Sum of Squares

Now to measure the quality of fit of a model, we break TSS down into two components. 

For any given $\mathbf{x}_i$, the prediction made by the model is 
$\hat{y_i} = \mathbf{x}_i^T\beta$.

We can break the total sum of squares into two parts:

* the residual $\epsilon$ is $y_i - \hat{y_i}$, and 
* the part that the model "explains" is $\hat{y_i} - \overline{y_i}.$

## RSS and ESS

Se we define Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) as:

$$
\text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\hat{y_i}\right)^2,
$$

and Explained Sum of Squares (ESS) as:

$$
\text{ESS} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\hat{y_i}-\overline{y}\right)^2,
$$

One can show that the total sum of squares is exactly equal to the sum of
squares of the residuals plus the sum of squares of the explained part.

In other words:

$$
\text{TSS} = \text{RSS} + \text{ESS}
$$

## $R^2$, cont.

Now, a good fit is one in which the model explains a large part of the variance
of $\mathbf{y}$.  

So the measure of fit $R^2$ is defined as:

$$
R^2 = \frac{\text{ESS}}{\text{TSS}} 
= 1-\frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}
= 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\hat{y_i}\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\overline{y}\right)^2}
$$

As a result, $0\leq R^2\leq 1$.

:::: {.fragment}
This is more specifically called $R^2$ __centered__.
::::


:::: {.fragment}
There is also an __uncentered__ version of $R^2$ defined as:

$$
R^2 (\text{uncentered}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\hat{y_i}\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2}
$$

::::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## $R^2$, cont.
:::

The closer the value of $R^2$ is to $1$ the better the fit of the regression:

* small values of RSS imply that the residuals are small and therefore we have a better fit.

$R^2$ is called the __coefficient of determination.__  

It tells us "how well does the model predict the data?"

## Warning

Do __not__ confuse $R^2$ with Pearson's $r$, which is the
__correlation coefficient.__

(To make matters worse, sometimes people talk about $r^2$... very confusing!)

:::: {.fragment}
The correlation coefficient tells us whether two variables are __correlated__.   

However, just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one is a
good __predictor__ of the other!

To compare ground truth with predictions, we always use $R^2$.

# OLS in Practice

## OLS in Practice

First, we'll look at a test case on synthetic data. We'll use Scikit-Learn's
`make_regression` function.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
from sklearn import datasets
X, y = datasets.make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=20, n_informative=5, bias=0.1, noise=30, random_state=1)
```

And then use the `statsmodels` package to fit the model.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Add a constant (intercept) to the design matrix
#X_with_intercept = sm.add_constant(X)
#model = sm.OLS(y, X_with_intercept)

model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()
```

---

And print the summary of the results.

```{python}
print(results.summary())
```

The $R^2$ value is very good.   We can see that the linear model does a very good
job of predicting the observations $y_i$.

::: {.callout-note}
The summary uses the __uncentered__ version of $R^2$ because, as the footnote says,
the model does not include a constant to account fo an intercept term. You can try
uncommenting the line `X_with_intercept = sm.add_constant(X)` and see that the
summary then uses the centered version of $R^2$.
:::

## Aside: Summary Statistics

Here is what all the statistics in the summary table mean:

1. **R-squared (Uncentered):**

* Definition: Measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable
  that is explained by the model, without subtracting the mean of the dependent variable.
* Formula:
  $R^2 (\text{uncentered}) = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum y_i^2}$

where $y_i$ is the actual value, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value from the regression.

* Interpretation: Higher values (closer to 1) indicate a better fit, but this
  version of $R^2$ can sometimes be misleading because it doesn’t account for the mean.

2. **Adjusted R-squared (Uncentered):**

* Definition: Adjusts the uncentered $R^2$ to account for the number of predictors
  in the model, preventing overfitting by penalizing for adding more variables.
* Formula:
    $R^2 (\text{adj, uncentered}) = 1 - \left( \frac{(1 - R^2 (\text{uncentered}))(n - 1)}{n - p} \right)$

where $n$ is the number of observations, and $p$ is the number of predictors in the model.

* Interpretation: It is a more conservative measure of fit than the regular $R^2$,
  particularly useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.

3. **F-statistic:**

* Definition: The F-statistic tests whether the overall regression model is
  significant, i.e., whether at least one of the predictors explains a significant
  amount of the variance in the dependent variable.
* Formula:
    $F = \frac{R^2 (\text{uncentered}) / (p - 1)}{(1 - R^2 (\text{uncentered})) / (n - p)}$

where $p$ is the number of predictors, and $n$ is the number of observations.

* Interpretation: A high F-statistic suggests that the model is statistically significant.

4. **Prob (F-statistic):**

* Definition: This is the p-value associated with the F-statistic. It indicates the
  probability that the observed F-statistic would occur if the null hypothesis
  (that none of the predictors are significant) were true.
* Interpretation: A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the
  model is statistically significant, meaning that at least one predictor is important.

5. **Log-Likelihood:**

* Definition: The log-likelihood measures the likelihood that the model could
  have produced the observed data. It is a measure of the fit of the model to the data.
* Formula:
    $\mathcal{L} = -\frac{n}{2} \log(2\pi \sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$

where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the residuals.

* Interpretation: A higher log-likelihood indicates a better fit of the model.

6. **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):**

* Definition: AIC is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a
  given set of data. It penalizes the likelihood function for adding too many
  parameters.
* Formula:
    $\text{AIC} = 2p - 2 \log(\mathcal{L})$

where $p$ is the number of parameters, and $\mathcal{L}$ is the log-likelihood.

* Interpretation: Lower AIC values suggest a better model fit, but it penalizes for overfitting.

7. **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):**

* Definition: Similar to AIC, BIC penalizes models with more parameters, but more
  strongly than AIC. It is used to select among models.

* Formula:
    $\text{BIC} = p \log(n) - 2 \log(\mathcal{L})$

where $p$ is the number of parameters, $n$ is the number of observations, and
$\mathcal{L}$ is the log-likelihood.

* Interpretation: A lower BIC indicates a better model, with stronger penalties for
  models with more parameters.

8. **Coefficient Table:**

* The first two columns are the independent variables and their coefficients. It
  is the $m$ in $y = mx + b$. One unit of change in the variable will affect the
  variable’s coefficient’s worth of change in the dependent variable. If the
  coefficient is negative, they have an inverse relationship. As one rises, the
  other falls.

* The `std error` is an estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient, a
  measurement of the amount of variation in the coefficient throughout its data
  points. 
  
* The `t` is related and is a measurement of the precision with which the coefficient
  was measured. A low std error compared to a high coefficient produces a
  high t statistic, which signifies a high significance for your coefficient.

* `P>|t|` is one of the most important statistics in the summary. It uses the
  `t` statistic to produce the `P` value, a measurement of how likely your
   coefficient is measured through our model by chance. For example, a `P` value
   of 0.378 is saying there is a 37.8% chance the variable has no affect on the
   dependent variable and the results are produced by chance. Proper model analysis
   will compare the `P` value to a previously established alpha value, or a
   threshold with which we can apply significance to our coefficient. A common
   alpha is 0.05, which few of our variables pass in this instance.

* `[0.025 and 0.975]` are both measurements of values of our coefficients within
  95% of our data, or within two standard deviations. Outside of these values can
  generally be considered outliers.

The coefficient description came from this [blog post](https://medium.com/swlh/interpreting-linear-regression-through-statsmodels-summary-4796d359035a)
which also describes the other statistics in the summary table.

Back to the example.

Some of the independent variables may not contribute to the accuracy of
the prediction. 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="%"}

```{python}
ax = ut.plotSetup3d(-2, 2, -2, 2, -200, 200)

# try columns of X with large coefficients, or not
ax.plot(X[:, 1], X[:, 2], 'ro', zs=y, markersize = 4)
```
:::
::: {.column width="%"}

Note that each parameter of an independent variable has an associated confidence
interval. 

If a coefficient is not distinguishable from zero, then we cannot assume that
there is any relationship between the independent variable and the observations.

:::
::::

---

In other words, if the confidence interval for the parameter includes zero, the
associated independent variable may not have any predictive value.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="%"}

```{python}
print('Confidence Intervals: {}'.format(results.conf_int()))
print('Parameters: {}'.format(results.params))
```

:::
::: {.column width="%"}

Find the independent variables that are not significant.

```{python}
CIs = results.conf_int()
notSignificant = (CIs[:,0] < 0) & (CIs[:,1] > 0)
notSignificant
```

Let's look at the shape of significant variables.

```{python}
Xsignif = X[:,~notSignificant]
Xsignif.shape
```

:::
::::

---

By eliminating independent variables that are not significant, we help avoid
overfitting.

```{python}
model = sm.OLS(y, Xsignif)
results = model.fit()
print(results.summary())
```

## Real Data: House Prices in Ames, Iowa

Let's see how powerful multiple regression can be on a real-world example.

A typical application of linear models is predicting house prices.

Linear models have been used for this problem for decades, and when a municipality
does a value assessment on your house, they typically use a linear model.

We can consider various measurable attributes of a house (its "features") as the
independent variables, and the most recent sale price of the house as the
dependent variable.

For our case study, we will use the features:

* Lot Area (sq ft), 
* Gross Living Area (sq ft), 
* Number of Fireplaces, 
* Number of Full Baths, 
* Number of Half Baths, 
* Garage Area (sq ft), 
* Basement Area (sq ft)

So our design matrix will have 8 columns (including the constant for the intercept):

$$
X\beta = \mathbf{y}
$$

and it will have one row for each house in the data set, with $y$ the sale price
of the house.

## Ames Housing Data

We will use data from housing sales in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2009:

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('data/ames-housing-data/train.csv')
```

```{python}
df[['LotArea', 'GrLivArea', 'Fireplaces', 'FullBath', 'HalfBath', 'GarageArea', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'SalePrice']].head()
```

Some things to note here:

* House prices are in dollars
* Areas are in square feet
* Rooms are in counts

Do we have scaling concerns here?  

No, because each feature will get its own $\beta$, which will correct for the
scaling differences between different units of measure.

```{python}
X_no_intercept = df[['LotArea', 'GrLivArea', 'Fireplaces', 'FullBath', 'HalfBath', 'GarageArea', 'TotalBsmtSF']]
X_intercept = sm.add_constant(X_no_intercept)
y = df['SalePrice'].values
```

::: {.callout-note}
Note that removing the intercept will cause the $R^2$ to go up, which is 
counter-intuitive.  The reason is explained here -- but amounts to the fact that
the formula for R2 with/without an intercept is different.

## Ames Housing Data, cont.
:::

Let's split the data into training and test sets.

```{python}
from sklearn import utils, model_selection
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(
    X_intercept, y, test_size = 0.5, random_state = 0)
```

Fit the model to the training data.

```{python}
model = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train)
results = model.fit()
print(results.summary())
```

We see that we have:

* $\beta_0$: Intercept of -\$42,850
* $\beta_1$: Marginal value of one square foot of Lot Area: \$0.23 
    * but __NOTICE__ - this coefficient is not statistically different from zero!
* $\beta_2$: Marginal value of one square foot of Gross Living Area: \$48 
* $\beta_3$: Marginal value of one additional fireplace: \$10,890
* $\beta_4$: Marginal value of one additional full bath: \$14,900
* $\beta_5$: Marginal value of one additional half bath: \$15,600
* $\beta_6$: Marginal value of one square foot of Garage Area: \$99
* $\beta_7$: Marginal value of one square foot of Basement Area: \$62

---

Is our model doing a good job?  

There are many statistics for testing this question, but we'll just look at the
predictions versus the ground truth.

For each house we compute its predicted sale value according to our model:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = X\hat{\beta}
$$

```{python}
%matplotlib inline
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,sharey = 'row', figsize=(12, 5))
y_oos_predict = results.predict(X_test)
r2_test = r2_score(y_test, y_oos_predict)
ax1.scatter(y_test, y_oos_predict, s = 8)
ax1.set_xlabel('True Price')
ax1.set_ylabel('Predicted Price')
ax1.plot([0,500000], [0,500000], 'r-')
ax1.axis('equal')
ax1.set_ylim([0, 500000])
ax1.set_xlim([0, 500000])
ax1.set_title(f'Out of Sample Prediction, $R^2$ is {r2_test:0.3f}')
#
y_is_predict = results.predict(X_train)
ax2.scatter(y_train, y_is_predict, s = 8)
r2_train = r2_score(y_train, y_is_predict)
ax2.set_xlabel('True Price')
ax2.plot([0,500000],[0,500000],'r-')
ax2.axis('equal')
ax2.set_ylim([0,500000])
ax2.set_xlim([0,500000])
ax2.set_title(f'In Sample Prediction, $R^2$ is {r2_train:0.3f}');
```

We see that the model does a reasonable job for house values less than about 
\$250,000. 

It tends to underestimate at both ends of the price range.

Note that the $R^2$ on the (held out) test data is 0.610.   

We are not doing as well on test data as on training data (somewhat to be expected).

For a better model, we'd want to consider more features of each house, and perhaps
some additional functions such as polynomials as components of our model.

## Recap

* Linear models are a powerful tool for prediction and inference
* The normal equations provide a simple way to compute the model coefficients
* The $R^2$ statistic provides a simple measure of fit
* Careful use of the model is required to avoid overfitting
