        "\n",
        "Here is what all the statistics in the summary table mean:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **R-squared (Uncentered):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: Measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable\n",
        "  that is explained by the model, without subtracting the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
        "* Formula:\n",
        "  $R^2 (\\text{uncentered}) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum y_i^2}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $y_i$ is the actual value, and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value from the regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretation: Higher values (closer to 1) indicate a better fit, but this\n",
        "  version of $R^2$ can sometimes be misleading because it doesn’t account for the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Adjusted R-squared (Uncentered):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: Adjusts the uncentered $R^2$ to account for the number of predictors\n",
        "  in the model, preventing overfitting by penalizing for adding more variables.\n",
        "* Formula:\n",
        "    $R^2 (\\text{adj, uncentered}) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1 - R^2 (\\text{uncentered}))(n - 1)}{n - p} \\right)$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $n$ is the number of observations, and $p$ is the number of predictors in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretation: It is a more conservative measure of fit than the regular $R^2$,\n",
        "  particularly useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **F-statistic:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: The F-statistic tests whether the overall regression model is\n",
        "  significant, i.e., whether at least one of the predictors explains a significant\n",
        "  amount of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
        "* Formula:\n",
        "    $F = \\frac{R^2 (\\text{uncentered}) / (p - 1)}{(1 - R^2 (\\text{uncentered})) / (n - p)}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $p$ is the number of predictors, and $n$ is the number of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretation: A high F-statistic suggests that the model is statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prob (F-statistic):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: This is the p-value associated with the F-statistic. It indicates the\n",
        "  probability that the observed F-statistic would occur if the null hypothesis\n",
        "  (that none of the predictors are significant) were true.\n",
        "* Interpretation: A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the\n",
        "  model is statistically significant, meaning that at least one predictor is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Log-Likelihood:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: The log-likelihood measures the likelihood that the model could\n",
        "  have produced the observed data. It is a measure of the fit of the model to the data.\n",
        "* Formula:\n",
        "    $\\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{n}{2} \\log(2\\pi \\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n",

        "where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretation: A higher log-likelihood indicates a better fit of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: AIC is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a\n",
        "  given set of data. It penalizes the likelihood function for adding too many\n",
        "  parameters.\n",
        "* Formula:\n",
        "    $\\text{AIC} = 2p - 2 \\log(\\mathcal{L})$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $p$ is the number of parameters, and $\\mathcal{L}$ is the log-likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretation: Lower AIC values suggest a better model fit, but it penalizes for overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: Similar to AIC, BIC penalizes models with more parameters, but more\n",
        "  strongly than AIC. It is used to select among models.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Formula:\n",
        "    $\\text{BIC} = p \\log(n) - 2 \\log(\\mathcal{L})$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $p$ is the number of parameters, $n$ is the number of observations, and\n",
        "$\\mathcal{L}$ is the log-likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretation: A lower BIC indicates a better model, with stronger penalties for\n",
        "  models with more parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Coefficient Table:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The first two columns are the independent variables and their coefficients. It\n",
        "  is the $m$ in $y = mx + b$. One unit of change in the variable will affect the\n",
        "  variable’s coefficient’s worth of change in the dependent variable. If the\n",
        "  coefficient is negative, they have an inverse relationship. As one rises, the\n",
        "  other falls.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `std error` is an estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient, a\n",
        "  measurement of the amount of variation in the coefficient throughout its data\n",
        "  points. \n",
        "  \n",
        "* The `t` is related and is a measurement of the precision with which the coefficient\n",

        "\n",
        "* `P>|t|` is one of the most important statistics in the summary. It uses the\n",
