## Clustering in Practice

[![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tools4ds/DS701-Course-Notes/blob/main/ds701_book/jupyter_notebooks/07-Clustering-II-in-practice.ipynb)


...featuring $k$-means

Today we'll do an extended example showing $k$-means clustering in practice and in the context of the python libraries
__`scikit-learn.`__

`scikit-learn` is the main python library for machine learning functions.

Our goals are to learn:

::: {.incremental}
* How clustering is used in practice
* Tools for evaluating the quality of a clustering
* Tools for assigning meaning or labels to a cluster
* Important visualizations
* A little bit about feature extraction for text

# Visualization

## Training wheels: Synthetic data

Generally, when learning about or developing a new unsupervised method, it's a 
good idea to try it out on a dataset in which you already know the "right" answer.

One way to do that is to generate synthetic data that has some known properties.
 
Among other things, `scikit-learn` contains tools for generating synthetic data
for testing.

We'll use [datasets.make_blobs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_blobs.html).

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import sklearn.datasets as sk_data
X, y, gt_centers = sk_data.make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, n_features=30,
                          center_box=(-10.0, 10.0), random_state=0, return_centers=True)
```

Let's check the shapes of the returned values:
```{python}
#| code-fold: false
print("X.shape: ", X.shape)
print("y.shape: ", y.shape)
print("gt_centers: ", gt_centers.shape)
```

::: {.notes}
`datasets.makeblobs` takes as arguments:

- `n_samples`: The number of samples to generate
- `n_features`: The number of features, or in other words the dimensionality of
each sample
- `center_box`: The bounds of the cluster centers
- `random_state`: The random seed for reproducibility
- `return_centers`: A boolean flag, True to return the centers so that we have ground truth
:::

## Visualize the Data

To get a sense of the raw data we can inspect it.

For statistical visualization, a good library is [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

Let's plot the `X` data as a matrix
[heatmap](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html), 
where every row is a data point and the columns are the features.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set the figure size to make the plot smaller
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))  # Adjust the width and height as needed
sns.heatmap(X, xticklabels = False, yticklabels = False, linewidths = 0, cbar = True)
plt.show()
```

---

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{python}
#| echo: false
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set the figure size to make the plot smaller
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))  # Adjust the width and height as needed
sns.heatmap(X, xticklabels = False, yticklabels = False, linewidths = 0, cbar = False)
plt.show()
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
Geometrically, these points live in a __30 dimensional__ space, so we cannot directly visualize their geometry.  

This is a __big problem__ that you will run into time and again!

We will discuss methods for visualizing high dimensional data later on.

For now, we will use a method that can turn a set of pairwise distances into an approximate 2-D representation __in some cases.__
:::
::::

---

So let's compute the pairwise distances, _in 30 dimensions_, for visualization purposes.

We can compute all pairwise distances in a single step using the `scikit-learn` [`metrics.euclidean_distances`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances.html) function:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import sklearn.metrics as metrics
euclidean_dists = metrics.euclidean_distances(X)
# euclidean_dists
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
print("Matrix shape is: ", euclidean_dists.shape)
```

Let's look at the upper left and lower right corners of the distances matrix.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import sklearn.metrics as metrics
import numpy as np

euclidean_dists = metrics.euclidean_distances(X)

# Function to print the matrix in the desired format
def print_matrix(matrix):
    # Upper left 3x3
    upper_left = matrix[:3, :3]
    # Lower right 3x3
    lower_right = matrix[-3:, -3:]
    
    # Print the upper left 3x3
    print("Upper left 3x3:")
    print(np.round(upper_left, 2))
    
    print("\n...")
    
    # Print the lower right 3x3
    print("Lower right 3x3:")
    print(np.round(lower_right, 2))

print_matrix(euclidean_dists)
```

Note that this produces a $100\times100$ symmetric matrix where the diagonal
is all zeros (distance from itself).

---

Let's look at a histogram of the distances.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn.metrics as metrics

# Compute the pairwise distances
euclidean_dists = metrics.euclidean_distances(X)

# Extract the lower triangular part of the matrix, excluding the diagonal
lower_triangular_values = euclidean_dists[np.tril_indices_from(euclidean_dists, k=-1)]

# Plot the histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(lower_triangular_values, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Histogram of Lower Diagonal Values of Euclidean Distances')
plt.xlabel('Distance')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

::: {.notes}
Remember that these are the pairwise distances, _in 30 dimensions_. So at least
with this dataset we see a clean separation presumably between inter-cluster
distances and intra-cluster distances.

How would the curse of dimensionality affect this? We discuss the curse of
dimensionality later in the course.
:::
## Visualizing with MDS

The idea behind [Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) is given a pairwise distance (or dissimilarity) matrix:

:::: {.incremental}
* Find a set of coordinates in 1, 2 or 3-D space that approximates those distances as well as possible.
* The points that are close (or far) in high dimensional space should be close (or far) in the reduced dimension space.
::::

## MDS Continued

Note that there are two forms of MDS:

* Metric MDS, of which Classical MDS is a special case, and has a closed form solution
  based on the eigenvectors of the centered distance matrix. 
    * $O(n^3)$ time complexity and $O(n^2)$ space complexity.
* Non-Metric MDS, which tries to find a non-parametric monotonic relationship
  between the dissimilarities and the target coordinates through an iterative approach. 
    * $O(n^2)$ time complexity.

MDS may not always work well if, for example the dissimilarities
are not well modeled by a metric like Euclidean distance.


## MDS Visualization Result

```{python}
#| label: code-mds
import sklearn.manifold
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
mds = sklearn.manifold.MDS(n_components=2, max_iter=3000, eps=1e-9, random_state=0,
                   dissimilarity = "precomputed", n_jobs = 1)
fit = mds.fit(euclidean_dists)
pos = fit.embedding_
plt.scatter(pos[:, 0], pos[:, 1], s=8)
plt.axis('square');
```

So we can see that, although our data lives in 30 dimensions, we can get a
sense of how the points are clustered by approximately placing the points into
two dimensions.

---

Out of curiosity, we can visualize the pairwise distance matrix using a heatmap.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
#| fig-align: center
sns.heatmap(euclidean_dists, xticklabels=False, yticklabels=False, linewidths=0, 
            square=True )
plt.show()
```


# Applying $k$-means

## Applying  $k$-Means

The Python package `scikit-learn` has a huge set of tools for unsupervised learning generally, and clustering specifically.  

These are in __`sklearn.cluster.`__

There are 3 functions in all the clustering classes, 

* **`fit()`**: builds the model from the training data.
    * For $k$-means, this function find the centroids.
* **`predict()`**: assigns labels to the data after building the models. 
    * For $k$-means this assigns the cluster number to a point.
* **`fit_predict()`**: calls fit and predict in a single step.

---

Let's go back to the original 30-D synthetic dataset and apply $k$-means and
show the cluster numbers.

```{python}
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(init = 'k-means++', n_clusters = 3, n_init = 100, random_state=0)
y_prime = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
print(y_prime)
```

For comparisons, here are the original cluster numbers.
```{python}
print(y)
```

Note that the $k$-means labels are different than the ground truth labels. 

---
We can remap the values according to

$$
\begin{align*}
0 &\rightarrow 0 \\
1 &\rightarrow 2 \\
2 &\rightarrow 1.
\end{align*}
$$

```{python}
# Remap y_prime
remap = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}
y_prime_remapped = np.vectorize(remap.get)(y_prime)
print("Remapped y_prime:")
print(y_prime_remapped)
```

```{python}
# Calculate the number of mismatched entries
mismatches = np.sum(y != y_prime_remapped)

# Calculate the percentage of mismatched entries
total_entries = len(y)
percentage_mismatched = (mismatches / total_entries) * 100

print(f"Percentage of mismatched entries: {percentage_mismatched:.2f}%")
```

To reiterate, mismatches are 0.00%.

---

All the tools in `scikit-learn` are implemented as Python objects.

Recall that the general sequence for using a tool from `scikit-learn` is:

* create the object, probably with some hyperparameter settings or initialization,
* run the method, generally by using the `fit()` function, and
* examine the results, which are generally property variables of the object.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_
labels = kmeans.labels_
inertia = kmeans.inertia_
```

And we see the resulting cluster inertia.

```{python}
print(f'Clustering inertia: {inertia:0.1f}.')
```

## Visualizing the Results of Clustering

Let's visualize the results.  We'll do that by reordering the data items according to their cluster.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
import numpy as np
idx = np.argsort(labels)
rX = X[idx, :]
sns.heatmap(rX, xticklabels = False, yticklabels = False, linewidths = 0)
plt.show()
```

You can clearly see the feature similarities of the samples in the same cluster.

---

We can also sort the pairwise distance matrix.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
rearranged_dists = euclidean_dists[idx,:][:,idx]
sns.heatmap(rearranged_dists, xticklabels = False, yticklabels = False, linewidths = 0, square = True)
plt.show()
```

Here again, you can see the inter-cluster sample distances are small.


# Cluster Evaluation

::: {.column width="50%"}

How do we know whether the clusters we get represent "real" structure in our data?

Consider a dataset of 100 points _uniformly distributed_ in the unit square.

> Question: Does that look uniformly distributed to you?
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
import pandas as pd
np.random.seed(42)
unif_X = np.random.default_rng().uniform(0, 1, 500)
unif_Y = np.random.default_rng().uniform(0, 1, 500)
df = pd.DataFrame(np.column_stack([unif_X, unif_Y]), columns = ['X', 'Y'])
df.plot('X', 'Y', kind = 'scatter', 
        colorbar = False, xlim = (0, 1), ylim = (0, 1), 
        figsize = (4, 4))
```

:::
::::



---

After running $k$-means on this data:

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
kmeans = KMeans(init = 'k-means++', n_clusters = 3, n_init = 500, random_state=0)
df['label'] = kmeans.fit_predict(df[['X', 'Y']])
df.plot('X', 'Y', kind = 'scatter', c = 'label', 
        colormap='viridis', colorbar = False, 
        xlim = (0, 1), ylim = (0, 1), 
        figsize = (4, 4))
```


:::: {.fragment}
The point is: clustering algorithms output some "clustering" of the data.
::::

---

The question is, does the clustering reflect __real__ structure?

:::: {.fragment}
Generally we encounter two problems:
::::

::: {.incremental}
* Are there *real* clusters in the data?
* If so, *how many* clusters are there?
:::

:::: {.fragment}
There is often no definitive answer to either of these questions.

You will often need to use your judgment in answering them.

## Clustering Metrics

Broadly separated into two categories.

:::: {.fragment}
1. **Ground truth based metrics**

We'll look at (Adjusted) Rand Index.

::::


## Rand Index (named after William M. Rand)

* Compare a proposed clustering, $C$, with ground truth labels, $T$.
* Look at the ratio, compared to total possible pairs, of pairs of points that are either
    * in the same cluster in both $T$ and $C$, or
    * in different clusters in both $T$ and $C$.

> Question: What are pairs not in either category?

## Rand Index Formula

The formula for the Rand Index is:

$$
\text{RI}(T,C) = \frac{a+b}{n \choose 2},
$$

- where $a$ is the number of pairs of points that are _in the same cluster_ in both $T$ and $C$, and
- $b$ is the number of pairs of points that are _in different clusters_ in both $T$ and $C$.

We normalize the sum by the combinatorial number of pairs of points, $n \choose 2$.

The __Rand Index__ is a value that falls in the range $[0, 1]$.

## Aside: n choose 2

* From combinatorics

**"n choose 2"** (written as $n \choose 2$) represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of n items, where the order doesn't matter.

#### Formula

$$
C(n,2) = n! / (2! × (n-2)!) = n(n-1)/2
$$

#### What it means

- It counts the number of **pairs** you can form from n items
- Order doesn't matter (so {A,B} is the same as {B,A})
- No repetition (you can't choose the same item twice)

#### Examples

- **3 choose 2**: From items {A, B, C}, you can form pairs {A,B}, {A,C}, {B,C} = **3 pairs**
- **4 choose 2**: From items {A, B, C, D}, you can form pairs {A,B}, {A,C}, {A,D}, {B,C}, {B,D}, {C,D} = **6 pairs**
- **5 choose 2**: From items {A, B, C, D, E}, you can form **10 pairs**

## Rand Index Example 1

Let's proceed by way of example.

We'll create another synthetic dataset of 3 clusters, so we have ground truth
labels $T$.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
X_rand, y_rand = sk_data.make_blobs(n_samples=[100, 300, 50], 
                                    centers = [[1.2, 2.4],[1.5, 3], [1.8, 3.5]], 
                                    n_features = 2,
                                    center_box = (-10.0, 10.0), 
                                    cluster_std = [.2, .3, .2], 
                                    random_state = 0)
df_rand_gt = pd.DataFrame(np.column_stack([X_rand[:, 0], X_rand[:, 1], y_rand]), columns = ['X', 'Y', 'label'])
df_rand_clust = df_rand_gt.copy()
kmeans = KMeans(init = 'k-means++', n_clusters = 3, n_init = 100, random_state=0)
df_rand_clust['label'] = kmeans.fit_predict(df_rand_gt[['X', 'Y']])
df_rand_clust['label'] = df_rand_clust['label'].replace({0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 0})
```

## Rand Index Example 1: Plotting the Results

We then run $k$-means with 3 clusters to on the datasets to get labels $C$ and plot the results:

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
figs, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 5))
df_rand_gt.plot('X', 'Y', 
                kind = 'scatter', 
                c = 'label', 
                colormap='viridis', 
                ax = axs[0],
                colorbar = False)
axs[0].set_title('Ground Truth (T)')
axs[0].set_axis_off()

df_rand_clust.plot('X', 'Y', 
                    kind = 'scatter', 
                    c = 'label', 
                    colormap='viridis', 
                    ax = axs[1],
                    colorbar = False)
axs[1].set_title('Clustering (C)')
axs[1].set_axis_off()
plt.show()
```

```{python}
print("The Rand index is: ", metrics.rand_score(df_rand_gt["label"], df_rand_clust["label"]))
```

## Adjusted Rand Index

How do we know whether a particular Rand Index (RI) score is significant?

We might compare it to the RI for a __random__ assignment of points to labels.

This leads to the __Adjusted Rand Index.__


## The Adjusted Rand Index

To *calibrate* the Rand Index this way, we use the expected Rand Index of random labels, denoted $E[\text{RI}]$.   

The Expected Rand Index considers $C$ to be a clustering that has the same cluster sizes as $T$, but the labels are assigned at random.

:::: {.fragment}
Using that, we define the adjusted Rand index as a simple __rescaling__ of RI:

$$
\text{ARI} = \frac{\text{RI} - E[\text{RI}]}{1 - E[\text{RI}]}
$$

Where $1$ represents $\max(\text{RI})$, the maximum possible Rand Index.

$E[\text{RI}]$ can be computed using combinatorics (we'll omit the derivation).

The below code block computes and prints the adjusted Rand index for the example on the previous slide.

```{python}
print("The adjusted Rand index is: ", metrics.adjusted_rand_score(df_rand_gt["label"], df_rand_clust["label"]))
```

::::

## Rand Index Example 2

Let's consider again our 3-cluster dataset with known labels `y`.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))  # Adjust the width and height as needed
sns.heatmap(X, xticklabels = False, yticklabels = False, linewidths = 0)
plt.show()
```


## Rand Index Example 2: Evaluating the Results

Here is the Rand Index and adjusted Rand Index, when using $k$-means to cluster this dataset for 1 to 10 clusters:

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
def ri_evaluate_clusters(X, max_clusters, ground_truth):
    ri = np.zeros(max_clusters+1)
    ri[0] = 0
    ari = np.zeros(max_clusters+1)
    ari[0] = 0
    for k in range(1,max_clusters+1):
        kmeans = KMeans(init='k-means++', n_clusters=k, n_init=10)
        kmeans.fit_predict(X)

        ri[k] = metrics.rand_score(kmeans.labels_, ground_truth)
        ari[k] = metrics.adjusted_rand_score(kmeans.labels_, ground_truth)
    return ri, ari
    
ri, ari = ri_evaluate_clusters(X, 10, y)
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.plot(range(1, len(ri)), ri[1:], 'ro-', range(1, len(ari)), ari[1:], 'b*-')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.title('$k$-means Clustering Compared to Known Labels')
plt.ylabel('Index value')
plt.legend(['RI', 'ARI'])
plt.show()
```

## RI vs ARI

The ARI provides a more nuanced evaluation of clustering similarity compared to the RI by accounting for the chance grouping of elements. Here are the key differences:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
__Rand Index (RI)__

- Measures Agreement: The RI measures the agreement between two clusterings by considering all pairs of elements and counting pairs that are either in the same or different clusters in both clusterings.
- Range: The RI ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement and 0 indicates no agreement.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
__Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)__

- Adjusts for Chance: The ARI adjusts the RI by considering the expected similarity that might occur by random chance. This adjustment makes the ARI a more reliable measure, especially when dealing with random or unbalanced clusterings.
- Range: The ARI can take values from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that the clustering is no better than random, while a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement. Negative values indicate that the clustering is worse than random.
:::
::::

## Information Provided by ARI

The ARI corrects for the fact that some level of agreement between clusterings can occur purely by chance. This makes it a more accurate measure of the true similarity between clusterings.

The ARI’s range allows for a clearer interpretation of clustering performance. An ARI of 0 means the clustering is no better than random, which is more informative than an RI of 0.5, which might still be influenced by chance.

The ARI allows for better comparison between different clustering results, as it normalizes the index to account for the chance agreement.

## Deciding on the Number of Clusters

The second question we face in evaluating a clustering is how many clusters are present.

In practice, to use $k$-means or most other clustering methods, one must choose $k$, the number of clusters, via some process.

## Inspecting Clustering Error

The first thing you might do is to look at the $k$-means objective function  and see if it levels off after a certain point.

Recall that the $k$-means objective can be considered the clustering "error".

If the error stops going down, that would suggest that the clustering is not improving as the number of clusters is increased.

Let's calculate the error for 1-11 clusters.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
error = np.zeros(11)
for k in range(1,11):
    kmeans = KMeans(init='k-means++', n_clusters = k, n_init = 10)
    kmeans.fit_predict(X)
    error[k] = kmeans.inertia_
```

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Inspecting Clustering Error
:::

For our synthetic data, here is the $k$-means objective, as a function of $k$:

```{python}
plt.plot(range(1, len(error)), error[1:], 'o-')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.title(r'$k$-means clustering performance of synthetic data')
plt.ylabel('Error')
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-warning}
This synthetic data is not at all typical. You will almost never see such a sharp change in the error function as we see here.
:::

---

Let's create a function to evaluate clusters for later use.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
def evaluate_clusters(X,max_clusters):
    error = np.zeros(max_clusters+1)
    error[0] = 0
    for k in range(1,max_clusters+1):
        kmeans = KMeans(init='k-means++', n_clusters=k, n_init=10)
        kmeans.fit_predict(X)
        error[k] = kmeans.inertia_
    return error
```

## Silhouette Coefficient

Usually, the ground truth labels are not known.

:::: {.fragment}
In that case, evaluation must be performed using the model itself.
::::

:::: {.fragment}
Recall our definition of clustering: 
::::

:::: {.fragment}
> a grouping of data objects, such that the objects within a group are similar (or near) to one another and dissimilar
> (or far) from the objects in other groups.
::::

:::: {.fragment}
This suggests a metric that could evaluate a clustering: comparing the distances between points within a cluster, to the
distances between points in different clusters.
::::

## Silhouette Coefficient

The Silhouette Coefficient is an example of such an evaluation, where a higher Silhouette Coefficient score relates to a
model with "better defined" clusters. 
We'll use [`sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#silhouette-coefficient)

::: {.incremental}
- Let $a$ be the mean distance between a data point and all other points in the same cluster.
- Let $b$ be the mean distance between a data point and all other points in the next nearest cluster. 
:::


:::: {.fragment}
Then the **Silhouette Coefficient** for a point is

$$ 
s = \frac{b-a}{\max(a, b)}.
$$

where $\max(a, b)$ is the larger of the two mean distances.

::::


 
## Why This Makes Sense

The **max(a, b)** normalization ensures the coefficient is always between -1 and 1:

- **If a < b** (good clustering): Point is closer to its own cluster
  - max(a, b) = b
  - s = (b - a) / b = 1 - (a/b) → **positive (0 to 1)**

- **If a > b** (poor clustering): Point is closer to other clusters  
  - max(a, b) = a
  - s = (b - a) / a = (b/a) - 1 → **negative (-1 to 0)**

- **If a = b** (boundary): Point is equidistant
  - s = 0

This creates a scale where:

- **+1** = perfectly clustered (a = 0, b > 0)
- **0** = on the boundary (a = b)  
- **-1** = completely misclustered (b = 0, a > 0)

## Overall Silhouette Score


The overall silhouette score is the average of the silhouette coefficient for each data point.

$$
(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n s_i
$$


## Silhouette Score for our synthetic data

We can calculate the Silhouette Score for our synthetic data:

```{python}
sc = metrics.silhouette_score(X, labels, metric='euclidean')
print('Silhouette Score:', sc)
```

::: {.content-visible when-profile="slides"}
## Silhouette Coefficient
:::

We can also evaluate it for 2-10 clusters and plot the results:

```{python}
def sc_evaluate_clusters(X, max_clusters, n_init, seed):
    s = np.zeros(max_clusters+1)
    s[0] = 0
    s[1] = 0
    for k in range(2, max_clusters+1):
        kmeans = KMeans(init='k-means++', n_clusters = k, n_init = n_init, random_state = seed)
        kmeans.fit_predict(X)
        s[k] = metrics.silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_, metric = 'euclidean')
    return s

s = sc_evaluate_clusters(X, 10, 10, 1)
plt.plot(range(2, len(s)), s[2:], 'o-')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.title('$k$-means clustering performance on synthetic data')
plt.ylabel('Silhouette Score')
plt.show()
```

:::: {.fragment}
Again, these results are more perfect than typical. 

But the general idea is to look for a local maximum in the Silhouette Coefficient as the potential number of clusters.

# k-means++

## k-means++ initialization
Proposed in 2007 by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii.

K-means++ improves the initialization of cluster centers to enhance the quality of the final clustering results. Here’s how it works.

- Choose an initial centroid $c_1$ randomly.
- Choose the next centroid $c_i$ with probability proportional to the squared distances to each data point.
    - This ensures that new centroids are spread out across the data space.
- Repeat this process until $k$ centroids have been selected.

Once the initial centroids are chosen, the standard k-means algorithm is applied.

The main advantage of k-means++ over randomly assigning points is that it reduces the likelihood of poor clustering results due to suboptimal initial centroids. This often leads to faster convergence and better overall clustering quality.

## Visualizing K-means++ Initialization Probability

Let's create a visualization that demonstrates how K-means++ selects the second centroid based on the squared distances from the first selected point:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import numpy as np

# Create a small uniformly distributed 2D dataset
np.random.seed(42)
n_points = 100
X = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, (n_points, 2))

# Select the first centroid randomly (simulate k-means++ first step)
first_centroid = X[0]  # For demonstration, we'll use the first point

# Calculate squared distances from all points to the first centroid
distances_squared = np.sum((X - first_centroid)**2, axis=1)

# Normalize to get probabilities (proportional to squared distances)
probabilities = distances_squared / np.sum(distances_squared)

# Create 3D plot
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the 2D points
ax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c='lightblue', s=30, alpha=0.6, label='Data points')

# Highlight the first centroid
ax.scatter(first_centroid[0], first_centroid[1], c='red', s=100, marker='*', 
           label='First centroid', edgecolors='darkred', linewidth=2)

# Create 3D visualization where z-axis represents probability
# We'll create a grid to show the probability surface
x_range = np.linspace(X[:, 0].min(), X[:, 0].max(), 50)
y_range = np.linspace(X[:, 1].min(), X[:, 1].max(), 50)
X_grid, Y_grid = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)

# Calculate probability for each grid point
grid_distances_squared = (X_grid - first_centroid[0])**2 + (Y_grid - first_centroid[1])**2
grid_probabilities = grid_distances_squared / np.sum(grid_distances_squared)

# Plot the probability surface
surf = ax.plot_surface(X_grid, Y_grid, grid_probabilities, 
                      alpha=0.3, cmap='viridis', 
                      linewidth=0, antialiased=True)

# Add the actual data points with their probabilities as z-values
ax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], probabilities, c='darkblue', s=20, alpha=0.8)

# Add colorbar
fig.colorbar(surf, ax=ax, shrink=0.5, aspect=20, label='Selection Probability')

# Set labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X coordinate')
ax.set_ylabel('Y coordinate')
ax.set_zlabel('Selection Probability')
ax.set_title('K-means++ Initialization Probability\n(Probability ∝ Squared Distance from First Centroid)')

# Add legend
ax.legend()

# Set viewing angle for better visualization
ax.view_init(elev=20, azim=45)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This 3D visualization shows:

- **Light Blue points**: The uniformly distributed 2D dataset
- **Red star**: The first randomly selected centroid
- **Surface and Dark Blue points**: The probability of selecting each point as the second centroid
- **Z-axis**: Represents the selection probability (proportional to squared distance from first centroid)

As you can see, points farther from the first centroid have higher selection probability, which helps ensure that the second centroid is well-separated from the first one.

# Real Data Clustering Example

## Taking the Training Wheels Off: Real Data

As a classic "real world" example, we'll use the 
["20 Newsgroup" data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#the-20-newsgroups-text-dataset)
provided as example data in scikit-learn.

We borrow code from this sklearn
[example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_document_clustering.html).

Let's load the data and count the number of documents and categories.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

# just use the following categories
categories = ['comp.os.ms-windows.misc', 'sci.space', 'rec.sport.baseball']

news_data = fetch_20newsgroups(
    remove = ('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'),
    subset = 'train', 
    categories = categories,
    shuffle = True,
    random_state = 42)

labels = news_data.target
unique_labels, category_sizes = np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)
true_k = unique_labels.shape[0]

print(f"{len(news_data.data)} documents - {true_k} categories")
```
## Example Document

Here is an example of one of the documents:

```{python}
print(news_data.data[0])
```

## Feature Extraction

We've discussed a bit the challenges of feature engineering.   

One of the most basic issues concerns how to encode categorical or text data in a form usable by algorithms that expect
numeric input.

The starting point is to note that one can encode a set using a binary vector with one component for each potential set
member.  

## Bag of Words

The so-called _bag of words_ encoding for a document is to treat the document as a _multiset_ of words.

> A _multiset_ is like a set but allows for multiple instances of each element.

That is, we simply count how many times each word occurs. It is a "bag" because all the order of the words in the
document is lost.

Surprisingly, we can still tell a lot about the document even without knowing its word ordering.

## Bag of Words Example

Consider this short document (one paragraph):

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog sleeps soundly at noon."

We ignore word order and count occurrences of each word.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import re
from collections import Counter

doc = (
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. "
    "The dog sleeps soundly at noon."
)

# simple tokenization: lowercase and keep alphabetic words
tokens = re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z']+", doc.lower())
counts = Counter(tokens)

# show vocabulary and frequencies sorted by word
sorted_counts = sorted(counts.items())
sorted_counts
```

You can also view the words and counts as separate vectors:

```{python}
vocabulary = [w for w, c in sorted_counts]
frequencies = [c for w, c in sorted_counts]
print('words   =', vocabulary)
print('counts  =', frequencies)
```

## Term Frequencies

Counting the number of times each word occurs in a document yields a vector of __term frequencies.__

However, simply using the "bag of words" directly has a number of drawbacks. First of all, large documents will have
more words than small documents.   

Hence it often makes sense to normalize the frequency vectors.

$\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ normalization are common.

## Bag of Words: Normalization


We can scale raw counts so documents of different lengths are comparable.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import math

try:
    sorted_counts  # reuse if already defined above
except NameError:
    import re
    from collections import Counter
    doc = (
        "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. "
        "The dog sleeps soundly at noon."
    )
    tokens = re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z']+", doc.lower())
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(tokens)
    sorted_counts = sorted(counts.items())

vocabulary = [w for w, c in sorted_counts]
counts_vec = [c for w, c in sorted_counts]

# L1 normalization: divide by sum of counts
total = sum(counts_vec)
l1 = [c / total for c in counts_vec]

# L2 normalization: divide by Euclidean norm
norm2 = math.sqrt(sum(c*c for c in counts_vec))
l2 = [c / norm2 for c in counts_vec]

print('words =', vocabulary)
print('\nL1-normalized counts =', l1)
print('\nL2-normalized counts =', l2)
```



## Tf-idf

Next, as noted in __scikit-learn__:

::: {.incremental}
* In a large text corpus, some words will be very frequent (e.g. “the”, “a”, “is” in English) hence carrying very
little meaningful information about the actual contents of the document. 
* If we were to feed the direct count data directly to a classifier those very frequent terms would overshadow the
frequencies of rarer yet more interesting terms.
* In order to re-weight the count features into floating point values suitable for usage by a classifier it is very
common to use the **tf–idf transform.**
* __Tf__ means __term-frequency__ while __tf–idf__ means __term-frequency times inverse document-frequency.__
* This is originally a term weighting scheme developed for information retrieval (as a ranking function for search
engines results), that has also found good use in document classification and clustering.
:::

::: {.fragment}
The idea is that rare words are more informative than common words.  

(This has connections to information theory).
:::

## Tf-idf Definition

Hence, the definition of tf-idf is as follows.

First:

$$
\text{tf}(t,d) = \text{Number of times term }t \text{ occurs in document } d~.
$$

Next, if $N$ is the total number of documents in the corpus $D$ then:

$$
\text{idf}(t,D)=\log{\frac{N}{|\{d\in D : t\in d \}|}},
$$

where the denominator is the number of documents in which the term $t$ appears.

And finally:

$$
\text{tf-idf}(t,d)=\text{tf}(t,d)\times \text{idf}(t,D).
$$

```{python}
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words = 'english', min_df = 4, max_df = 0.8)
data = vectorizer.fit_transform(news_data.data)
```

## TF-IDF on Newsgroup Data



```{python}
#| code-fold: true
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import numpy as np

# Reuse previously loaded 20 Newsgroups subset if available; otherwise load it
try:
    news_data
    categories
except NameError:
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
    categories = ['comp.os.ms-windows.misc', 'sci.space', 'rec.sport.baseball']
    news_data = fetch_20newsgroups(
        remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'),
        subset='train',
        categories=categories,
        shuffle=True,
        random_state=42,
    )

# pick one example document from each category
docs_by_cat = []
labels = news_data.target
for cat_index in range(len(categories)):
    # first document whose label matches the category index
    indices = np.where(labels == cat_index)[0]
    if len(indices) > 0:
        docs_by_cat.append(news_data.data[indices[0]])

# compute TF-IDF on the selected three documents
tfidf_vec = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', min_df=1, max_df=1.0)
X = tfidf_vec.fit_transform(docs_by_cat)
feature_names = np.array(tfidf_vec.get_feature_names_out())

def top_terms(row_vector, k=10):
    row = row_vector.toarray().ravel()
    if row.sum() == 0:
        return []
    top_idx = np.argsort(row)[-k:][::-1]
    return list(zip(feature_names[top_idx], row[top_idx]))

for i, doc in enumerate(docs_by_cat):
    print(f"\nDocument {i+1} (category: {categories[i]}): Top TF-IDF terms")
    for term, score in top_terms(X[i], k=10):
        print(f"  {term:20s} {score:.4f}")
```


## Getting to know the Data

```{python}
print(f'The datas type is {type(data)} and the shape is {data.shape}')
```
For what it's worth we can look at the data feature matrix:

```{python}

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(8,4))
dum = sns.heatmap(data[1:100,1:200].todense(), xticklabels=False, yticklabels=False, 
            linewidths=0, cbar=True, ax=ax1)
```

```{python}
print(news_data.target)
print(news_data.target_names)
```

## Selecting the Number of Clusters -- Error

Now let's look at the different cluster measures versus number of clusters.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
error = evaluate_clusters(data, 10)
plt.plot(range(1, len(error)), error[1:])
plt.title('$k$-means Clustering Performance on Newsgroup Articles')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.ylabel('Error')
plt.show()
```

## Selecting the Number of Clusters -- RI

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
ri, ari = ri_evaluate_clusters(data, 10, news_data.target)
plt.plot(range(1, len(ari)), ari[1:], 'o-')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.title('$k$-means Clustering Compared to Known Labels\nNewsgroup Articles')
plt.ylabel('Adjusted Rand Index')
plt.show()
```

## Selecting the Number of Clusters -- Silhouette Score

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
s = sc_evaluate_clusters(data, 10, 100, 3)
plt.plot(range(2, len(s)), s[2:], 'o-')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.title('$k$-means clustering performance on Newsgroup Articles')
plt.ylabel('Silhouette Score')
plt.show()
```

## Looking into the clusters

Run $k$-means with 3 clusters:

```{python}
k = 3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = k, init = 'k-means++', max_iter = 100, n_init = 25, random_state = 3)
kmeans.fit_predict(data)
```

Find the top 10 terms per cluster:

```{python}
asc_order_centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_.argsort()#[:, ::-1]
order_centroids = asc_order_centroids[:,::-1]
terms = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for i in range(k):
    print(f'Cluster {i}:')
    for ind in order_centroids[i, :10]:
        print(f' {terms[ind]}')
    print('')
```

## Pairwise Distances Matrix

Let's calculate the pairwise distances matrix.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
euclidean_dists = metrics.euclidean_distances(data)
labels = kmeans.labels_
idx = np.argsort(labels)
clustered_dists = euclidean_dists[idx][:,idx]
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,6))
dum = sns.heatmap(clustered_dists, xticklabels=False, yticklabels=False, linewidths=0, square=True, cbar=True, ax=ax1)
```

## MDS Embedding

Let's visualize with MDS.   

Note that MDS is a slow algorithm and we can't do all 1700+ data points quickly, so we will take a random sample.

```{python}
import random
n_items = euclidean_dists.shape[0]
random.seed(42)
subset = random.sample(range(n_items), 500)

fit = mds.fit(euclidean_dists[subset][:, subset])
pos = fit.embedding_
```

We have the labels:

```{python}
labels
```

## MDS Embedding

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
colorblind_palette = ['#E69F00', '#56B4E9', '#009E73', '#F0E442', '#0072B2']
cols = [colorblind_palette[l] for l in labels[subset]]
plt.scatter(pos[:, 0], pos[:, 1], s = 12, c = cols)
plt.title('MDS Embedding of Newsgroup Articles')

unique_labels = np.unique(labels[subset])
# Create legend handles and labels based on unique labels
handles = [plt.Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', markerfacecolor=colorblind_palette[l], markersize=10) for l in unique_labels]
legend_labels = [f'Cluster {l}' for l in unique_labels]
# Add the legend to the plot
plt.legend(handles, legend_labels, title='Clusters')
plt.show()
```

## Recap and Next

We've covered:

* How clustering is used in practice
* Tools for evaluating the quality of a clustering
* Tools for assigning meaning or labels to a cluster
* Important visualizations
* A little bit about feature extraction for text

Next time, we'll look at: 

* Hierarchical clustering
* Gaussian mixture models
