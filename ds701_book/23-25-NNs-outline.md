## The "Unreasonable" Effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks

UDL examples of all the types of models...

> Note: should we add more generative AI examples? chatgpt? NotebookLM? Suno.AI?

### Emergent behavior in Pre-Trained LLMs

Can we expand on this phenomenon a little bit? 

Is GPT scaling laws article relevant?


### Theory Sometimes Follows Invention

Still relevant? Think so....

## Loss Functions for Model Fitting

Relates a bit to models previously discussed...

discusses simple convex loss functions with global minimum vs non-convex 
loss functions without many local minima

## Gradient Descent Intuitively
