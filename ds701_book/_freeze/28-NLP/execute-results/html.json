These include\n\n- sparse representations, like one-hot encodings and TF-IDF encodings\n- word embeddings.\n\nHowever, prior to creating a numerical representation of text, we need to **tokenize** the text.\n\n## Tokenization\n\n* Tokenization is the process of splitting raw text into smaller pieces, called *tokens*. \n\n* Tokens can be individual characters, words, subwords, or sentences.\n\n<br>\n\nExamples of character and word tokenization:\n\n```Show me the money```\n\nCharacter tokenization:\n\n```['S', 'h', 'o', 'w', 'm', 'e', 't', 'h', 'e', 'm', 'o', 'n', 'e', 'y']```.\n\nWord tokenization:\n\n```['Show', 'me', 'the', 'money'] ```\n\n## Simple Tokenization in Python\n\nSimple python implementation:\n\n::: {#df138738 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\n# Character and word tokenization\n\nsentence = \"Show me the money\"\nword_tokens = sentence.split()\nprint(word_tokens)\n\ncharacter_tokens = [char for char in sentence if char != ' ']\nprint(character_tokens)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n['Show', 'me', 'the', 'money']\n['S', 'h', 'o', 'w', 'm', 'e', 't', 'h', 'e', 'm', 'o', 'n', 'e', 'y']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Tokenization Methods\n\n* There are advantages and disadvantages to different tokenization methods. \n* We showed two very simple strategies. \n\nHowever, there are other strategies, such as subword and sentence tokenization,\nsee for example:\n\n - [Byte-Pair Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte-pair_encoding),\n - [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).\n\nSee Andrej Karpathy's [Let's build a GPT tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) video for a deep dive.\n\n* With tokenization, our goal is to not lose meaning with the tokens. With character based tokenization, especially for English (non-character based languages) we certainly lose meaning. \n\n## Huggingface Tokenization\n\nHere is a demo of how to tokenize using the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) package from Huggingface.\n\n::: {#67993d33 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, logging\n\nlogging.set_verbosity_warning()\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence)\nprint(tokens)\n\n# Try a more advanced sentence\nsentence2 = \"Let's try to see if we can get this transformer to tokenize.\"\ntokens2 = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence2)\nprint(tokens2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n['Show', 'me', 'the', 'money']\n['Let', \"'\", 's', 'try', 'to', 'see', 'if', 'we', 'can', 'get', 'this', 'transform', '##er', 'to', 'token', '##ize', '.']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Tokens, Token IDs, and Vocabulary\n\n* Associated to each token is a unique token ID. \n\n* The total number of unique tokens that a model can recognize and process is the *vocabulary size*. \n\n  * The *vocabulary* is the collection of all the unique tokens.\n\n* The tokens (and token ids) alone hold no (semantic) information. What is needed is a numerical representation that *encodes* this information. \n\n* There are different ways to achieve this:\n\n  - One encoding technique that we already considered is one-hot encodings. \n\n  - Another more powerful encoding method, is the creation of word embeddings.\n\n## tiktokenizer\n\n![tiktokenizer](figs/tiktokenizer.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n[Tiktokenizer demo](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/)\n\n## Sparse Representations\n\nWe have previously considered the following sparse representations of textual data.\n\n### One-Hot Encoding\n- Each word is represented as a vector of zeros and a single one.\n- Simple but inefficient for large vocabularies.\n\n**Example**\n\nGiven the words cat, dog, and emu here are sample one-hot encodings\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{cat} &= [1, 0, 0]^{T}, \\\\\n\\text{dog} &= [0, 1, 0]^{T}, \\\\\n\\text{emu} &= [0, 0, 1]^{T}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Bag of Words (BoW)\n- Represents text as a collection of word counts.\n- Ignores grammar and word order.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose we have the following sentences\n\n1. The cat sat on the mat.\n1. The dog sat on the log.\n1. The emu sat on the mat.\n\n| Sentence                              | the | cat | sat | on | mat | dog | log | emu |\n|---------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|-----|-----|----------|\n| \"The cat sat on the mat.\"             |  2  |  1  |  1  | 1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |    0     |\n| \"The dog sat on the log.\"             |  2  |  0  |  1  | 1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |    0     |\n| \"The emu sat on the mat.\"        |  2  |  0  |  1  | 1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |    1     |\n\n---\n\n### TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n\n- Adjusts word frequency by its importance across documents.\n- Highlights unique words in a document.\n- See [Clustering in Practice](https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/07-Clustering-II-in-practice.html#tf-idf) \n  for more details.\n\n**Example**\n\nThe TF-IDF representations corresponding to the previous sentences.\n\n|       | cat       | dog       | log       | mat       | on        | emu  | sat       | the       |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Sentence 1 | 0.4698    | 0.0000    | 0.0000    | 0.4698    | 0.3546    | 0.0000    | 0.3546    | 0.7093    |\n| Sentence 2 | 0.0000    | 0.4698    | 0.4698    | 0.0000    | 0.3546    | 0.0000    | 0.3546    | 0.7093    |\n| Sentence 3 | 0.0000    | 0.0000    | 0.0000    | 0.4698    | 0.3546    | 0.4698    | 0.3546    | 0.7093    |\n\n## Word Embeddings\n\nWord embeddings represent words as **dense vectors in high-dimensional spaces**.\n\nThe individual values of the vector may be difficult to interpret, but the \noverall pattern is that _words with similar meanings are close to each other_, \nin the sense that their vectors have small angles with each other.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Question:</b> Is that true with one-hot encodings?</summary>\n\n<b>Answer:</b> No, with one-hot encodings, the similarity of two words is 0 if they are different, and 1 if they are the same.\n</details>\n\n\nThe similarity of two word embeddings is the cosine of the angle between the two\nvectors. Recall that for two vectors $v_1, v_2\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the formula \nfor the cosine of the angle between them is\n\n$$ \n\\cos{(\\theta)} = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot v_2}{\\Vert v_1 \\Vert_2 \\Vert v_2 \\Vert_2}.\n$$\n\n## Static vs Contextual Embeddings\n\nWord embeddings can be **static** or **contextual**. \n\n**Static:**<br>\nA static embedding is when each word has a single embedding, e.g., Word2Vec. \n\n**Contextual:**<br>\nA contextual embedding (used by more complex language model embedding algorithms) allows the embedding for a word to change depending on its context in a sentence.\n\n## Word2Vec: Static Embeddings\n\n**Word2Vec** [@mikolov2013efficient] is a technique to learn static word embeddings from large text corpora.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n\n- Each word has a **single fixed vector** representation\n- Trained to predict context (CBOW) or predict word from context (Skip-gram)\n- Captures semantic relationships: *king - man + woman ≈ queen*\n- Popular pre-trained models: Google News (300d), GloVe\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Fast to train and use \n- Efficient for large vocabularies\n- Good for similarity tasks, clustering\n- Pre-trained embeddings available\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Limited context and no word order information.\n- For phrases and sentences, the embedding is the average of the word embeddings.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Contextual vs Static Embeddings\n\n| Feature | Static (Word2Vec, GloVe) | Contextual (BERT, GPT) |\n|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Representation** | One vector per word | Different vectors per context |\n| **Example** | \"bank\" always same vector | \"bank\" differs in \"river bank\" vs \"bank account\" |\n| **Model Type** | Shallow neural network | Deep transformer model |\n| **Training** | Fast, lightweight | Slow, resource-intensive |\n| **Best For** | Similarity, clustering, simple tasks | Complex understanding, ambiguity resolution |\n| **Dimensionality** | 100-300 dimensions | 768-1024+ dimensions |\n\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column}\n\n**When to use Word2Vec:**\n\n- Limited computational resources\n- Task doesn't require deep context understanding\n- Working with domain-specific corpora (train custom embeddings)\n\n:::\n::: {.column}\n\n**When to use Contextual Embeddings:**\n\n- Need to handle polysemy (words with multiple meanings)\n- Complex NLP tasks (NER, question answering, translation)\n- Have access to GPU resources\n:::\n::: \n \n\n\n# Language Models\n\n\n## Language Models\n\nA language model is a statistical tool that predicts the probability of a sequence of words. It helps in understanding and generating human language by learning patterns and structures from large text corpora.\n\n1. **N-gram Models**:\n   - Predict the next word based on the previous  $n-1$ words.\n   - Simple and effective for many tasks but limited by fixed context size.\n\n1. **Neural Language Models**:\n   - Use neural networks to capture more complex patterns.\n   - Examples include *RNNs*, *LSTMs*, and **Transformers**.\n\nSee [RNNs and LSTMs](#27-RNN.qmd) for more details.\n\nWe'll skip N-grams and focus on Transformers.\n\n\n# Transformers\n\n\n## Transformers: High-Level Overview\n\nTransformers [@vaswani2017attention] are the foundation of modern NLP systems.\n\n**Key innovations:**\n\n- Use **attention mechanism** to process entire sequences (e.g. context window) in parallel\n  - Although optimizations exist, given huge context window sizes, e.g. [Flash Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) (chunking), sparse attention.\n- Revolutionized NLP and enabled LLMs (ChatGPT, BERT, GPT-4)\n- Scalable across GPUs for massive models\n\n## Transformer Architecture\n\n![](drawio/Transformer_Enc_Dec.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**Components:**\n\n- **Encoder**: Processes input text, creates rich representations\n- **Decoder**: Generates output text using encoder representations\n- **Attention**: Allows model to focus on relevant parts of input\n\n> Other variants of the transformer architecture include the encoder-only and decoder-only architectures.\n\n\n## Encoder-Decoder Building Blocks\n\n![](drawio/TransformerOriginal.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n> Can grow the model size by increasing the number of layers and the number of attention heads.\n\n## Transformer Building Block\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n**Components:**\n\n- Attention mechanism -- gathers information from neighboring tokens in the input sequence.\n- Feed-forward neural network -- processes the information gathered by the attention mechanism.\n- Layer normalization -- normalizes the output of the feed-forward neural network.\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](drawio/Encoder.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n\n## The Attention Mechanism\n\nAttention allows models to understand which words are most relevant to each other.\n\n**Example sentence:**\n\n> \"The elephant didn't cross the river because **it** was tired.\"\n\n**Question:** What does \"it\" refer to?\n\n- Attention helps the model determine that **\"it\" = \"elephant\"** (not \"river\")\n- The model \"attends\" more strongly to \"elephant\" when processing \"it\"\n\n## How Attention Works (Simplified)\n\nFor each word in a sentence:\n\n1. **Calculate relevance scores** with all other words\n2. **Apply [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)** to get attention weights (sum to 1)\n3. **Compute weighted sum** of word representations\n4. Result: each word's representation includes context from relevant words\n\n**Multi-head attention**: Run multiple attention operations in parallel to capture different types of relationships\n\n> It's a form of adaptive network where some weights are derived from inputs.\n\n## Queries, Keys, and Values\n\nThe attention mechanism uses three types of vectors for each word:\n\n- **Query (Q)**: \"What am I looking for?\"\n- **Key (K)**: \"What do I contain?\"\n- **Value (V)**: \"What information do I have?\"\n\n**Attention formula:**\n$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n\n- Compute similarity between queries and keys\n- Normalize with softmax\n- Weight the values by attention scores\n\n## Attention Visualized\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nDarker connections show stronger attention.\n\nWhen processing \"it\", the model attends most to \"elephant\".\n\nThis is how transformers handle long-range dependencies and ambiguity.\n\nSee also [BertViz](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz) for a visual exploration of the attention mechanism.\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![](drawio/VisualizedAttention.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n# Transformer Architectures\n\n## 3 Types of Transformer Models\n\n1. **Encoder-Decoder** – Sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., machine translation)\n   - Example: Original Transformer, T5\n\n2. **Encoder-Only** – Transforms text embeddings into latent representations for understanding and classification tasks\n   - Example: **BERT** (sentiment analysis, NER, classification)\n\n3. **Decoder-Only** – Predicts next token used for text generation and completion\n   -

highly customizable:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom umap import UMAP\nfrom hdbscan import HDBSCAN\n\n# Custom embedding model\nembedding_model = SentenceTransformer(\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n\n# Custom UMAP settings\numap_model = UMAP(n_neighbors=15, n_components=5, min_dist=0.0)\n\n# Custom HDBSCAN settings\nhdbscan_model = HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=15, min_samples=10)\n\n# Create custom BERTopic model\ntopic_model = BERTopic(\n    embedding_model=embedding_model,\n    umap_model=umap_model,\n    hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model,\n    verbose=False\n)\n```\n\n## BERTopic: Practical Tips\n\n**Best practices:**\n\n- Use at least 100-200 documents per expected topic\n- For short texts, use smaller `min_topic_size` (5-10)\n- For long documents, increase `min_topic_size` (20-50)\n- Experiment with different embedding models\n- Save models for reuse: `topic_model.save(\"my_model\")`\n\n**Common issues:**\n\n- Too many outliers? Lower `min_cluster_size`\n- Topics too broad? Increase `min_topic_size`\n- Slow performance? Use smaller embedding model\n- Poor topics? Try different embedding model or more documents\n\n# Summary\n\n## NLP Tools and Applications Recap\n\n**What we covered:**\n\n1. **Text representation**: Sparse (TF-IDF) vs embeddings (Word2Vec vs BERT)\n2. **Language models**: N-grams → Transformers\n3. **Transformers**: Attention mechanism (QKV), encoder-decoder architecture\n4. **Transformer architectures**: BERT (encoder), GPT (decoder)\n5. **NLP Tools**: NLTK (learning) vs spaCy (production)\n6. **Named Entity Recognition**: spaCy for production-ready NER\n7. **Topic Modeling**: BERTopic with transformer embeddings\n\n## References\n\n",
